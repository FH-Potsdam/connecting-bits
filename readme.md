# Connecting bits - Play the _Chinese whispers_ game with machines

## The project.
Connecting bits is a chain of multilingual machines to play the _Chinese whispers_ game with. It consists of four boxes situated in a room. Any box can record one person's voice, turn it into text and transfer it to its next sibling box. Every time a new box receives the message, it translates it to a different language and says it out loud. Finally, when the message has been transfered through all four boxes, the message goes back to the first original box. As in the _Chinese whispers_ game so far, one expects the message to be the same unless something distorted or altered it during the process.

## The boxes.
These boxes are home made cubic machines composed of various mechanical elements and electronics.

### The design.

### The hardware.
The boxes consist of:

- **A led:** To indicate that the box is speaking
- **Two servo motors:** To move the box as it listens and speaks and to give it a living character
- **An infrared sensor:** To detect the presence of someone standing in front of it and start the audio recording
- **A microphone:** To record the person's voice
- **A speaker:** To… you know… speak…
- **A particle photon board:** To control all this and be controlled over wifi

## The makers.
We are student from the [University of Applied Sciences of Potsdam](http://fh-potsdam.de) \[aka] @fh-potsdam. Our team is composed of interface, product, and graphic designers that took part in the course [“Input Output - Introduction to process-oriented design”]( https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6176) supervised by [Fabian Morón Zirfas]( https://github.com/fabiantheblind). This project was developed during the last third of the course. To see other projects we have made, visit [this repository](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/eingabe-ausgabe/2015-2016/).
