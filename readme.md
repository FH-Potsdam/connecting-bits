# TRANSL8R - Play the _Chinese whispers_ game with machines

## The project.
TRANSL8R is a chain of multilingual machines to play the _Chinese whispers_ game with. It consists of four boxes situated in a room, where any box can record one person's voice and transfer it to its next sibling box. Every time a new box receives the message, it translates it to a different language and says it out loud through its speaker. Finally, after the message was translated four times, the box the person originally spoke to says the altered message out loud. As in the _Chinese whispers game_, one expects the message to be the same unless something distorted it during the process.

## The boxes.
These boxes are home made cubic machines composed of various mechanical elements and electronics.

### The design.
blabla

### The hardware.
The boxes consist of:

- **An LED:** To indicate that the box is speaking
- **Two servo motors:** To move the box as it listens and speaks and to give it a living character
- **An infrared sensor:** To detect the presence of someone standing in front of it and start the audio recording
- **A microphone:** To record the person's voice
- **A speaker:** To… you know… speak…
- **A particle photon board:** To control all this and be controlled over Wi-Fi
 
We also used:
- **A Mac mini**: to record, translate and play the translations

## The makers.
We are students from the [University of Applied Sciences of Potsdam](http://fh-potsdam.de) \[aka] @fh-potsdam. Our team consists of interface, product, and graphic designers that took part in the course [“Input Output - Introduction to process-oriented design”]( https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6176) by [Fabian Morón Zirfas]( https://github.com/fabiantheblind). This project was developed during the last third of the course. To see the other projects we made, visit [this repository](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/eingabe-ausgabe/2015-2016/).
